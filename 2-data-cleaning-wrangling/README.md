**Data Analysis Using Python: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide Featuring NYC Open Data**

Part 2: Data Inspection, Cleaning and Wrangling in Python

**Introduction**  
Part 2 demonstrates various ways to to inspect, clean, wrangle, and detect any outliers in your data. The project is located in my notebook [2-data-cleaning-wrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/blob/master/2-data-cleaning-wrangling/2-data-cleaning-wrangling.ipynb).

Key sections as follows:

**3. Data Inspection**
 - 3.1 Previewing Data
 - 3.2 Calcualting Summary Statistics
 - 3.3 Identifying Null/NA Values
 
**4. Data Cleaning/Wrangling** 
 - 4.1 Previewing Column Values
 - 4.2 Filling In Null/NA Values With Median
 - 4.3 Plotting Histogram of Raw Construction Year Values   
 - 4.4 Identiyfying Values Not Between Years 1 and 2020
 - 4.5 Replacing Values Not Between Years 1 and 2020 with the Median
 - 4.6 Plotting Histogram of Construction Years Between 1 and 2020
 - 4.7 Identifying Buildings Built Before 1652 - Possible Outliers
 - 4.8 Replacing Values Less Than 1652 with the Median
 - 4.9 Plotting Histogram of Construction Years with Cleaned Column

**5. Detecting Outliers**
 - 5.1. Making a Box Plot
    - 5.1.1 Calculating Interquartile Range (IQR)
    - 5.1.2 Box Plot of Construction Year Values
    - 5.1.3 Making Histograms of Values Above and Below Box Plot Whiskers
 - 5.2 Z-Scores
    - 5.2.1 Calculating Z-Scores
    - 5.2.2 Identifying Possible Outliers from Z-Score
    - 5.2.3 Making Histograms of Construction Year Raw and Normalized (Z-Score) Values
