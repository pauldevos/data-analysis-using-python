**A Beginner's Guide to Data Analysis Using Python**

Part 1: Data Loading, Storage, and File Formats

**Introduction**
Part 1 of this series displays various ways to read (load) and write (save) data using the Python programming language. I have chosen to work with datasets exclusively from NYC Open Data. Additionally, we will go through common fle formats found on NYC Open Data such as comma-separated values (csv), JavaScript Object Notation (json), shapefiles (i.e. format for geometric location and attribute information), and zip files.

There are three parts to my project as follows:

Reading In Data,
Writing Out Data, and
Reading In Data From Your Local Folder.

The project can be located in my notebook [1-reading-writing-files.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/blob/master/1-reading-writing-files/1-reading-writing-files.ipynb).

I am new to the open source community, so feedback is very welcome!
