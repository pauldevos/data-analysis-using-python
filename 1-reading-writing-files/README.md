**Data Analysis Using Python: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide Featuring NYC Open Data**

Part 1: Reading and Writing Files in Python

**Introduction**  
Part 1 demonstrates various ways to read (load) and write (save) data using the Python programming language. The datasets contain common file formats such as comma-separated values (csv), JavaScript Object Notation (json), shapefiles (i.e. format for geometric location and attribute information) and zip files.

Sections as follows:

- Reading In Data,  
- Writing Out Data, and  
- Reading In Data From Your Local Folder.

The project is located in my notebook [1-reading-writing-files.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/blob/master/1-reading-writing-files/1-reading-writing-files.ipynb).

Feedback is very welcome!
